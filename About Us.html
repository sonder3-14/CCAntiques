<h1>
OUR COMPANY
</h1>
<p>
Our company and the brand, CC Antiques, was created with one objective in mind. That is making antique products and services easily accessible from the comfort of your own home. 
</p>

<h1>
OUR VALUES
</h1>
<p>
We make our customers the highest priority for everything we do. Without them we wouldn't be where we are today. We always make sure they are treated accordingly and in line with our core values. Those values are respect, honesty and ethics. We make sure to exhibit those values when communicating, carrying out workplace tasks and providing services.
</p>

<h1>
OUR PRODUCTS
</h1>
<p>
Our products are usually found or given to us in a damaged or "ruined" state. However we are able to fix and repair anything given to us and sell it to our loyal customers at prices significantly lower than what you'd find elsewhere. We are yet to receive anything that's too broeken or too great a challenge to add to our wonderful collection. See for yourself!
